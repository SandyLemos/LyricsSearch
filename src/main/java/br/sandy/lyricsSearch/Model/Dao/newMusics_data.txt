Title:Numb
Artist:Linkin Park
Album:Meteora
Lyric:I'm tired of being what you want me to beFeeling so faithless, lost under the surfaceI don't know what you're expecting of mePut under the pressure of walking in your shoesEvery step that I take is another mistake to you(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)I've become so numb, I can't feel you thereBecome so tired, so much more awareI'm becoming this, all I want to doIs be more like me and be less like youCan't you see that you're smothering me?Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control'Cause everything that you thought I would beHas fallen apart right in front of youEvery step that I take is another mistake to you(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)And every second I waste is more than I can takeI've become so numb, I can't feel you thereBecome so tired, so much more awareI'm becoming this, all I want to doIs be more like me and be less like youAnd I knowI may end up failing tooBut I knowYou were just like me, with someone disappointed in youI've become so numb, I can't feel you thereBecome so tired, so much more awareI'm becoming this, all I want to doIs be more like me and be less like youI've become so numb, I can't feel you thereI'm tired of being what you want me to beI've become so numb, I can't feel you thereI'm tired of being what you want me to be
